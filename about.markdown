Hi! My name is Cole.

I'm a software engineer.

This blog is my attempt to publish my own study notes on interesting topics.  I hope they can help contribute to your own journey of learning!

<!-- I'm a software engineer. motivated to work on projects that address real-world problems.

Academically, I'm interested in operating systems (Linux in particular), networking, the hardware/software interface, and electronics.

I like to summarize topics in my own words, long-form, in order to prove to myself I've learned a topic.  I don't expect much, if any, of what I write to be novel, but sometimes being exposed to the same content in a different voice can for reasons unknown induce those ah-ha moments. If there is any purpose to my adding to the compendium of blog summaries, stackoverflow posts, and documentation that inhabit the web, then this would be it. -->
